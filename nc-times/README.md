# The NC TIMES

Hello, I am glad that you are reading this, it only means that you are about to dive into a completely out-of-this-world experience with this amazing App.

NC TIMES is a front-end project made with React and Vite. Making different requests to my previously built API will display different articles and comments about them. Feel free to navigate around with the user-friendly navigation bar. You can also filter the articles by the different existing topics. Once chosen, choose the order of display.

Coming soon, you will be able to log in and make comments under your personal account.

To access the app, use the following link: [[LINK](https://bohemianrapsodyjournal.netlify.app/)]

If you want to contribute to this repo, feel free to fork it. To run it on your Node, just do `npm install` to install all the required dependencies, then run "npm run dev" to host locally the app.
To open the app locally place your mous on the link in the terminal and click it whilst pressing ctrl.

**NOTE:** The Node version used to develop this app is Node.js v14.16.2.
